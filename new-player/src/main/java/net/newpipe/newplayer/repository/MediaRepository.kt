/**
 * You, dear Developer who uses NewPlayer, will want to implement MediaRepository.
 * This interface is the thing that will enable NewPlayer to access your content.
 * Just like the ViewModel and the View, the Repository is an element of the MVVM architecture.
 * This repository is basically the "view" to your data.
 *
 * ## How does MediaRepository work
 * Every piece of media that can be defined as a unit is referred to as an *item*.
 * An item can be a YouTube video or a media.ccc talk, or a video stored on your phones storage
 *
 * With each *item* associated are so called [Stream]s. Every *item* has at least one or multiple
 * [Stream]s associated with it.
 * A stream referees to one individual media file that can either be accessed from the internet
 * via its unique URL or is stored locally on your phone's storage, and can be referred to via
 * URI. In other words a [Stream] refers to one media container (like an mpeg4 or a webm file).
 *
 * Every [Stream] contains one or multiple tracks, which NewPlayer calls [StreamTrack]s.
 * Each track refers to either one encoded stream of Video or one encoded stream of Audio.
 *
 * The way it works is that you tell [NewPlayer] to play a certain **item**. [NewPlayer] will then
 * *ask* the repository for information about this *item*.
 * [Stream]s and everything else, like [Subtitle]s, [Chapter]s, this **item**'s [Metadata],
 * preview thumbnails etc., basically things [NewPlayer] might want to know about an **item**, is
 * supplied through the repository.
 *
 * ## What is an item
 * An item is a string or tag that uniquely identifies one specific piece or unit of media.
 * Something like a youtube video.
 * For example an **item** can be the link to a youtube video or a media.ccc video, or the filepath
 * and name of a video stored on your phone.
 *
 * You can also use uuid's or randomly generated values to create items. You basically define
 * what an item should be, as long as the string meets these two criteria:
 * - The string must be unique for one piece of media (the item must be relational)
 * - The repository must be able to understand that item string and be able to return
 *   the information related to that **item**.
 *
 * So the way you identify and use **item** with [NewPlayer] depends on how [MediaRepository]
 * is implemented.
